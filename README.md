## A small, SFML powered game toolkit with primitive Lua scripting
This was just supposed to be a tilemap editor, but then science went too far.
Created during the first year of my degree.

To use the Editor, compile and run the project in Debug mode <br>
To run the standalone game, compile and run the project in Release mode
